Plan
----

* DONE - Migrate examples to unit tests.
* DONE - Add prototype parsing code and test sources.
* DONE - Move exceptions out of parser code into dedicated exceptions file.
* DONE - Split grammar out of parser base and into its own module.
* DONE - Rename package from pyrtfng to rtfng.
* DONE - Update the generate script to accept file names as parameters, thus only
  generating RTF files for the make_() methods in those files (as opposed to
  traversing the whole tree).
* DONE - Add tests for the unicode support.
* DONE - Increment to version 0.9.1

* Rename varaibles to remove underscores (convert to camelCase).
* Rename instance variables in PropertySets from UpperCamelCase to
  lowerCamelCase.
* Remove extraneous spaces between operators, parens, etc.
* Add new lines where they should be (no run-ons after colons).
* Standardize indents to be 4 spaces.
* Remove deepcopy wherever possible.
* Increment to version 0.9.2


* Rename modules to accord with PEP-8/Twisted coding standard.
* Rename class methods to accord with PEP-8/Twisted coding standard.
* Increment to version 0.9.3

* Reorganize package to something along the following lines:
    rtfng
        header
            Version
            Character Set
            Font Table
            Color Table
            Stylesheet
            List Table
            Revisions
        document
            section
                DONE - Section
                Section Formatting
                Header/Footer
            paragraph
                DONE - Paragraph
                Formatting/Tabs
                Bullets/Numbering
                Borders/Shading
                Objects/Frames
                DONE - Table/Cell
            character
                Font/Formatting/Properties
                Borders/Shading
                Hilighting
                Special Characters
        bookmarks
        objects
            Pictures
            Drawings
        annotations
            Footnotes
            Comments
        fields
        indices
            Index
            Table of Contents
* Add support for a small subset of the API that does most of what people need,
  letting users types as few lines as possible to create RTF docs.
* Increment to version 1.0.0.

* Make classes new-style.
* Unify the codes in constants.Languages to eliminate redundancy.
* Increment to version 1.0.1.

* Sort out the character TEXT and Text redundancy.
* Simplify rendering along the lines of the "write" idiom.
* Increment to version 1.0.2.

* Add append() method to doc that is a dispatcher, appending to appropriate
  attrs based on type (e.g., instead of doc.Sections.append(section), one would
  only need to do doc.append(section)).
* Increment to version 1.0.3.

* Refactor TabPropertySet leader types into a single attribute.
* Replace use of apply() with extended call syntax.
* Increment to version 1.0.4.

* Get parser to the point where it can parse everything the current code can
  generate.
* Increment to version 1.1.0.

* Add more RTF-spec support to both the writer and the parser.
* Increment to version 1.2.0.


Completed
---------

* DONE - Rename package to pyrtfng.
* DONE - Clean up basic white space issues (mixed tab/space, file encodings,
    DOS characters, etc.)
* DONE - Increment to version 0.9.0


Issues
------
* Tested the initial examples; they don't seem to render properly for TextEdit
  on Mac OS X.
* RTF docs should not create any more structure by default than is absolutely
  necessary:
    o the auto-creation of the header needs to go;
    o
